multiple file types handling using paperclip and uploading the files to amazon s3
Here I've tried to handle images and videos in the same model depending on the user input.

Gems required to head start:
  gem 'paperclip'
  gem 'paperclip-av-transcoder'
  gem 'delayed_paperclip'

Include the above gems in your gemfile and you are good to tweak the tyc_message.rb file according to your needs. :)

As this is an initial commit I will be maintaing this repo and refactor the code.

For now you can go ahead and have a look at how the code works.
